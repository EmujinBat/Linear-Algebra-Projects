# Linear-Algebra-Projects
Math for Data Science class projects (PCA, Neural Network, K-Means Clustering, Linear Regression) completed in Google Colab. Each project demonstrates the application of linear algebra concepts to data science, following the Data Science Lifecycle with a focus on understanding and implementing specific predictive models.

1. k-Means Clustering 
   - Applied K-Means clustering (via Lloydâ€™s Algorithm) to group patients based on the presence of heart disease.
2. Linear Regression 
   - Implemented simple linear regression from scratch using matrix notation and ordinary least squares (OLS)
   - Calculated the best-fit line and evaluated model accuracy using the sum of squared errors (SSE)
3. PCA Analysis on Iris dataset
   - Constructing Covariance Matrix and computing eigenvalues using numpy
4. Neural Network Parameter tuning
   - Built a neural network from scratch using NumPy with custom feedforward and backpropagation logic
   - Tuned hyperparameters to evaluate performance and understand training behavior
